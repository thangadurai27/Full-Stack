              <h3>From Our Hearts to Your Plate</h3>
              <p>Having run a preschool for more than ten years, we were seeking a new business opportunity that would offer a different pace and atmosphere. Our aim was to focus on our family and engage in activities that we enjoy. As we are fond of coffee, music, and socializing with pleasant individuals, we decided to open a coffee shop where we could experiment with food and beverage concepts and have a good time with our loved ones and community.</p>

              <h3>The Best Bite in the Neighborhood</h3>
              <p>The Green Leaf came into existence in 2016, but unfortunately, we had to cease operations by the end of 2019 due to health concerns and the pandemic. However, after nearly four years, we are thrilled to announce that we are reopening at our new location, where we can once again share delicious food, warm smiles, and engaging conversations with our community.</p>
